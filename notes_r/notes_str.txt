THE str FUNCTION
Displays structure of an R object in one line
This is similar to the summary() function
You can also split the data (with split) and then apply str

SIMULATION
rnorm (random variables w/mean, std)
dnorm (evaluate normal prob. density at a given point)
pnorm (evaluate the cdf for a normal distribution)
rpois (generate random Poisson variates with a given rate)
Prefixes for random variables: d (density), r (random #s), p (cdf), q (quantile)
Can specify lower and upper tails, and length of resultant vector
Remember to set the seed for a random number generation process
For a linear model, we can also generate random numbers.
The sample function lets you draw randomly from a given set
Distributions built in: normal, poisson, binomial, exponential, gamma, etc

R PROFILER
Profiling: a systematic way to examine time spent in parts of pgogram
Don't optimize until you've done performance analysis, for the most part
system.time() tells you how long a process is taking
User time (computer processing time) vs. elapsed time (wall clock time
Rprof() starts the profiler (compiled), then summarize with summaryRprof()
Further reason why breaking your code into functions is a good idea!
