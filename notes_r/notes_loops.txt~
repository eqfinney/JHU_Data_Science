LOOPS IN R
Some loop functions
  - lapply (loop over a list and evaluate function on each element)
  - sapply (simplify result of lapply)
  - apply (apply function over margins of array)
  - tapply (apply function over vector subsets)
  - mapply (lapply, but multivariate)
lapply always returns a list upon which a function has been acted
These functions often use anonymous functions within the argument of the loop
apply is usually used to apply a function to a matrix
  "margin" is the axis along which you are applying the functon
  (note shortcuts exist: rowSums, rowMeans, colSums, colMeans)
mapply works when you have a function with multiple variables
tapply is a lot like lapply etc but works over vector subsets
split is also very useful - can split objects into groups
