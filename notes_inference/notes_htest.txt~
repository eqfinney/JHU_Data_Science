T CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
Confidence intervals of the form E_st +/- ZQ*SE_est
T confidence intervals of the form E_st +/- TQ*SE_est (wider tails)
Gosset's t distribution has thicker tails than a normal distribution
  Indexed by dof, assumes data are iid Gaussian: (X-mu)/(S/sqrt(n)) for n-1 dof
  As there are fewer degrees of freedom, wider tails and less in the middle

AB TESTING
Compare two independent groups with a t test, but can't use a paired t test
  Y-X +/- TQ*S_est(sqrt((1/nx)+(1/ny))), and TQ has nx-ny-2 dof
  S_est^2 = {(nx-1)Sx^2 + (ny-1)Sy^2}/(nx+ny-2)
Note: the package reshape2 in R can be super-helpful
  Also: violin plots are pretty cool!
  t.test gives options for equal or unequal variance assumptions
With unequal variance: Y-X +/- TQ*(sqrt(Sx^2/nx + Sy^2/ny))
  TQ depends on a very specific formula for degrees of freedom
  Use the unequal variance interval, not actually a t interval
For binomial we can compare by:
  - relative risk, risk difference, odds ratio
  - chi^2 tests, normal approximations, exact tests

HYPOTHESIS TESTING
Null hypothesis represents status quo, assumed true
Four outcomes:
  - correctly accept null hypothesis (H0, H0)
  - Type I error (actually H0, decide Ha)
  - correctly reject null hypothesis (Ha, H0)
  - Type II error (actually Ha, decide H0)
Reject the null hypothesis if X>C,
  where C is chosen so that probability of Type I error is, say, below 0.05

T-TESTS
The test statistic (X-mean)/(s/sqrt(n)) follows a T distribution with 15 dof
We may want to reject the null hypothesis if result is too far from the mean
If you fail to reject the one-sided test, we will also fail to reject two-sided
Confidence interval results will be consistent with two-sided t-tests
For two groups, rejection rules same, but testing if one mean equal to the other

P-VALUES
Idea: suppose nothing is going on, how unusual is the result?
  How likely are we to get a result as or more extreme than this, if H0 true?
  Also: smallest value of alpha for which you would still reject H0
For a two-sided test, you have to double the probability on both tails
