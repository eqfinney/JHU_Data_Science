POWER
Power: probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false
Tends to be more important for null results than for non-null results
Useful for study design: want sample size large enough to catch an effect
Power = 1-beta, where beta is the type II error probability
Power is a function that depends on the mean of the null hypothesis
Power of mua: pnorm(mu0+z*s/sqrt(n), mean=mua, sd=s/sqrt(n), lower.tail=FALSE)
Easier to detect differences with bigger differences, and larger sample sizes
Power=(1-beta)=P(X>(mu0+z*s/sqrt(n)); mu=mua)
