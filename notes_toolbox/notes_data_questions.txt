TYPES OF DATA SCIENCE QUESTIONS
Descriptive analyses: describe a data set, not generalizable w/o more analysis
Exploratory analyses: find relationships you previously didn't know about
Correlation does not imply causation - exploratory should not be generalized
Inferential analyses: use small sample of data, extrapolate to bigger population
Predictive analyses: use data of some objects to predict values of other objects
If X predicts Y, it does NOT mean that X causes Y. More data, simple model good
Causal analyses: find out what happens to one variable when you change another
Usually requires randomized studies to find causation, or you introduce bias
Usually identified as average effects rather than applicable to individuals
Mechanistic analyses: understand the exact changes in variables that lead to other changes in other variables for individual objects
Incredibly hard to infer because they require simple and certain models

WHAT IS DATA?
Values of qualitative/quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items
Set of items: population, set of objects in which you have interest
Variables: a measurement or characteristic of an item in which you have interest
Qualitative: non-ordered, non-numeric. 
Quantitative: measured on a continuous scale, often numeric
Data do not necessarily come in a clean, tabled form
More important than the data, however, are the questions you are asking
Some data sets are so big that you can only analyze them through the cloud
Hadoop is only relevant if you have more data than fit on your local compyuter
But large data set does not imply the right data seT, no matter how big data are

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Know and care about the analysis plan, all aspects of design and analysis
For any study, have a plan for data and code sharing
For A/B test, want a large difference with small variability to infer correctly
Confounding variables: other variables that influence your variables of interest
Spurious correlation often is associated with confounding variables
Fix as many variables as possible and if you can't fix it, stratify or randomize
Stratify: use an equal number of unfixed variables in both samples
For a prediction study, a difference in the mean is insufficient to predict
You need separated distributions in order to come up with a decent training set
Sensitivity: P(positive test|disease)
Specificity: P(negative test|no disease)
Positive predictive value: P(disease|positive test)   
Negative predictive value: P(no disease|negative test)
Accuracy: P(correct outcome)
Beware data dredging - test multiple times until you get the answer you like
Good experiments are replicable, measure variability, generalize, transparent
Prediction != inference, although both can be important
